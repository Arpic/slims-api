# SLIMS-API

The SLIMS API allows you to write SLIMSGATE plugins and SLIMS Vaadin plugins. 

Visit [templates](templates/) to look for empty example plugins.

The examples here can be used to get some insight into how you could write your own plugin. To build your own plugins you will need access to our api classes. Please contact your SLIMS project lead to get access.
